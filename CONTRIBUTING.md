# CONTRIBUTING

## PRs welcome

## Adding a Function
Please add new functions. This repository is intended for functions that can be copied/pasted/adapted to people's real world environments. We are especially looking at functions where you are working around not being able to download whatever package would be able to do it for you.

With all new functions, please:

- one function one file
- name the file the function
- use roxygen formatting
- add a blurb for your new function in the README

## Edit a Function
Please edit functions. Make revisions to meet your needs, to generalize the function, etc. If your edits create a new use case, go ahead and add a new function rather than edit.
