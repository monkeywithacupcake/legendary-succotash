# Collection of editable R functions

Put whatever here. I am going to use this repository to hold functions that I will need again. 

## Functions Included

**createValueBoxes()** 
: Motivated a desire to have flexdashboard style value boxes in other .Rmd and inspired by the [Stack Overflow question and answer session on the same idea](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47105282/valuebox-like-function-for-static-reports)
Stefan Avey's last update was used as a base for this function. I turned it into a function which is more portable and reusable for different approaches.
